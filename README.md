### Details Grid
In this report, The aim is to analyse the data by creating an interactive and dynamic grid view. The grid will display key details such as Album Name, Artist Name, Track Name, and other relevant attributes.

Key Requirements:
- Grid View with Essential Fields:
  1) The Grid should present critical data points for an intuitive and structured view.
- Drill Through Functionality:
  1) Users should be able to drill through from the main  reports to explore underlying data for detailed insights.
  2) The drilled-through data should be exportable to a CSV file based on user requirements.
- Drill Down, Drill Up, and Hierarchy:
  1) The grid should support hierarchical navigation, allowing users to drill down and up for in-depth data exploration.
